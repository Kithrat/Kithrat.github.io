  <h1>Under Construction</h1>
  <h1> Welcome, I'm Kithrat </h1>
  <p> I have been fascinated by technology as far back as I can remember. As a young kid I discovered my dad's original GameBoy and immediately set about trying to understand Qbert despite having never heard of video games before and being far too young to succeed. From that moment on I can recall being entranced by anything with a screen. A draw that hold to this day, for better or worse. My toys look a bit different now, but they are still made of silicon and glass when broken down- a gaming desktop running Arch Linux with a tiling window manager, a repurposed desktop that now serves as the start of my homelab, acting as a Proxmox hypervisor, an e-paper smart picture frame created using a Waveshare screen and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, the list could go on. This site is very much a work in progress, but take a look around and feel free to reach out. </p>
